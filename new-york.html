          <h3>Cuisine of New York City</h3>
          <p>
            The cuisine of New York City comprises many cuisines belonging to
            various ethnic groups that have entered the United States through
            the city. Almost all ethnic cuisines are well represented in New
            York City, both within and outside the various ethnic neighborhoods.

            New York City was also the founding city of New York Restaurant Week
            which has spread around the world due to the discounted prices that
            such a deal offers. In New York City there are over 12,000 bodegas,
            delis and groceries and many among them are open 24 hours a day, 7
            days a week.

            Much of the cuisine usually associated with New York City stems in
            part from its large community of Ashkenazi Jews and their
            descendants. The world famous New York institution of the
            "Delicatessen," commonly referred to as a "Deli," was originally an
            institution of the city's Jewry.

            Much of New York City's Jewish fare has become popular around the
            globe, especially bagels. (New York City's Jewish community is also
            famously fond of Chinese food, and many members of this community
            think of it as their second ethnic cuisine.
